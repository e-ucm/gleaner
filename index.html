          <h1><img src="images/achtung.png" height="30" width="30" /><strong>GLEANER is now RAGE Analytics</strong></h1>
          <p>(Feb 2015) The experience creating GLEANER has been used to create <strong>RAGE Analytics</strong>. The development of GLEANER has ceased and continues in the <a href="//github.com/e-ucm/rage-analytics">RAGE Analytics GitHub repo</a></p>          

          <h2><a name="gleaner" class="anchor" href="#gleaner"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>GLEANER: Game LEarning ANalytics for Educational Research</h2>
          <p><em>GLEANER</em> is a Learning Analytics framework focused on improving the data analysis processes over educational data, with a special focus on highly interactive contents.</p>
          <p>This framework eases the analysis and interpretation of the data generated by highly interactive contents (including, but not limited to serious games). It resolves significant challenges in deciding which data should be captured, how this data should be clustered and analyzed and which analysis models can yield adequate and trustworthy assessment results. There are still, however, some outstanding questions regarding how to find out which visualization models are more effective.</p>

          <h3>About <em>GLEANER</em></h3>
          <p>The core <em>GLEANER</em> component is a backend service capable of collecting Game and Learning Analytics data from different game sources. The collection is performed though an open API that can be called from any game engine capable of sending HTTP requests (an open source generic library component is also provided).</p>
          <p>Both the API and the server configuration process are detailed in the <a href="http://e-ucm.github.io/gleaner/doc.html">technical documentation page.</a></p>

          <h3>Research</h3>

          <p><em>GLEANER</em> is an ongoing research project aiming to unleash the potential of Game and Learning Analytics and to support the next generation of serious games. As such, we are open to all kinds of feedback, and would be open to supporting you in creating your own GLEANER-aware games or your own GLEANER server deployments.</p>

          <p>All the background and rationale behind GLEANER is further explained in some recent academic articles:</p>
